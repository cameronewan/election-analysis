# Election-Audit Summary:
  First and foremost, one way that you can apply the script that we wrote to any other election is loading in a different csv file from a different election. If they wanted to breakdown the data in a different way, for example, how many women and how many men voted. Provided we had that data we would only have to change a couple lines of code to show that in our analysis. Finally, we could apply our script to encompass the whole state and not just counties.
